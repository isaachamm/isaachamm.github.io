## Technologies used for landing site:
- TailwindCSS
	- Right now, I actually have a mix of plain CSS and Tailwind, which I don't love. I stole the plain CSS from Vite, but I think I would prefer to either have it all Tailwind or all regular CSS, as the mix can get really confusing. Will clean up.
- React-router with HashRouter
    - Hash Router is a temporary fix--had to use it to work with Github pages. Need to improve routing from that to something else. But a working temporary solution.
